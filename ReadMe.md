# PowerLearn Side Tasks

This repository contains five side tasks demonstrating fundamental Python concepts. Each task explores different data structures and programming techniques commonly used in Python development.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Task 1 - List Sum**: Create and manipulate lists of integers to calculate their sum.
2. **Task 2 - Book Tuple**: Demonstrate the use of tuples by storing and iterating through book titles.
3. **Task 3 - Person Dictionary**: Store and retrieve personal information using Python dictionaries.
4. **Task 4 - Common Set Elements**: Work with sets to find common elements between two collections.
5. **Task 5 - Odd Length Words**: Use list comprehension to filter words based on character count.

## Repository Structure

Each task has its own directory containing:
- Python script implementing the task
- README.md file explaining the task's purpose and functionality

## Getting Started

To explore these tasks:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/powerlearn-side-tasks.git
   ```

2. Navigate to any task directory to see its specific implementation and documentation.

## Learning Objectives

These tasks are designed to help you understand:
- Different Python data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
- Basic operations and manipulations on these data structures
- User input handling
- List comprehension and filtering
- Iteration techniques
