# Task 4 - Common Set Elements

## Description
This project allows the user to create two sets of integers and then computes a new set containing only the elements that are common to both sets. It demonstrates basic set operations such as intersections in Python.

### Key Concepts:
- Set creation and usage
- Set intersection operation
- Handling user input for sets

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-4-common-set-elements.git
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python common_set_elements.py
   ```

## Example Output
```
Enter the elements for the first set (separated by spaces): 1 2 3 4 5
Enter the elements for the second set (separated by spaces): 4 5 6 7 8
The common elements are: {4, 5}
```
